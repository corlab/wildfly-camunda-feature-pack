    We already bring in our subsystem module in /galleon-pack/wildfly-feature-pack-build.xml. If that was not the
    case (e.g. if we were not using a a feature), we would add it here.
    Also, if some modules (or other packages) you have not defined are not a dependency of those modules, you
    can add those here.
